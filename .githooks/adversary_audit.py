"""adversary_audit.py - the post-hoc AUDIT TRIPWIRE for the G39 adversarial commit gate.

The pre-commit gate is advisory by construction (git cannot make client-side hooks
mandatory): --no-verify, plumbing (commit-tree/update-ref), GUI clients, and unarmed
clones all walk around it. This auditor is the layer no local trick escapes, because it
reads immutable OUTPUT, not process: for every commit after the baseline that changes
CODE, it recomputes the changed blobs' sha256s and demands a matching durable note on
refs/notes/adversary (written by `adversary_gate.py record` from the post-commit hook).
A commit with no note, a note missing a changed path, or a note whose sha does not match
the recomputed blob is a VIOLATION. OVERRIDE notes (the owner's one-shot escape) pass but
are listed loudly; --strict-override turns them into violations too.

SELF-CONTAINED BY DESIGN: stdlib only, no imports from adversary_gate.py - this file is
VENDORED into each repo's .githooks/ by install_gate.py so CI can run it without the
Tools repo. The code-path rules (CODE_EXTS/GATED_PREFIXES) are therefore duplicated from
adversary_gate.py; audit_selftest.py asserts the two stay identical (drift tripwire).

Usage:
  python adversary_audit.py [--repo P] [--baseline REV] [--ref refs/notes/adversary]
                            [--json] [--strict-override]
Baseline default: the commit sha in <repo>/.githooks/adversary_baseline (written by the
installer at arming time - commits before it predate durable notarization and would be
pure false alarms). Exit 0 clean / 1 violations (or overrides under --strict-override) /
2 usage or environment error.

Honest limits (documented, not hidden): a determined fraudster can forge a note with
correct shas and fabricated verdict text; the auditor proves PROCESS EVIDENCE EXISTS and
matches the bytes, and the recorded artifact text lets a human (or a re-run review)
check the evidence itself. Detection, not prevention - by design.
